# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest

This project predicts **Gold Prices** based on historical financial indicators using a **Random Forest Regressor**. It includes data preprocessing, correlation analysis, model evaluation, and visualization of actual vs predicted values.

---

## Project Overview
Gold prices fluctuate based on multiple economic factors. This project uses machine learning to analyze historical data and predict the gold price using key market indicators.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Correlation analysis using a heatmap  
- Model training with **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Model evaluation with R² score  
- Visualization of predicted vs actual gold prices  

---

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**

---

## Model
The model used is the **Random Forest Regressor**, which is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their results for more accurate predictions.
